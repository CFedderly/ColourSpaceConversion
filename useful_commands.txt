============ Setting Up ARM Compiler and Simulation =====================
// need to ssh into one of the lab machines
ssh <username>@c[69=101].seng.uvic.ca

//setup ARM compiler for simulation 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14180185/gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi-command-not-found

//locate path of ARM compiler
locate arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc

//add path of ARM compiler to environment variables
PATH=<path-to-compiler>:$PATH

//double check that path was added
echo $PATH

//compile with static libraries
arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc -static -march=armv5 file.c -o file.exe

// simulate the resulting executable with simulation arm
qemu-arm file.exe

=========== Profile With gprof =========================================
tutorial - http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/gprof-tutorial/
include "-pg" flag during compilation
run the executable to produce gmon.out
profile the execution and record data in text file:
	gprof file.exe gmon.out > analysis.txt
use "-b" flag to suppress verbose output:
	gprof -b file.exe gmon.out > analysis.txt
